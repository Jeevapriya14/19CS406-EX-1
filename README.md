# 19CS406-EX-1 IMPLEMENTATION OF STOP AND WAIT PROTOCOL


DATE :09-03-2023

AIM : 
  
  To implement socket programming date and time display from client to server using TCPSockets

ALGORITHM :

Server:
```
1. Create a server socket and bind it to port.
2. Listen for new connection and when a connection arrives, accept it.
3. Send server‟s date and time to the client.
4. Read client‟s IP address sent by the client.
5. Display the client details.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the server is terminated.
7. Close all streams.
8. Close the server socket.
9. Stop.
```
Client:
```
1. Create a client socket and connect it to the server‟s port number.
2. Retrieve its own IP address using built-in function.
3. Send its address to the server.
4. Display the date & time sent by the server.
5. Close the input and output streams.
6. Close the client socket.
7. Stop
```
PROGRAM :

CLIENT :
```
import socket
from datetime import datetime
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',8000))
s.listen(5)
c,addr=s.accept()
print("Client Address : ",addr)
now = datetime.now()
c.send(now.strftime("%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S").encode())
ack=c.recv(1024).decode()
if ack:
    print(ack)
c.close()
```
SERVER :

```
import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.connect(('localhost',8000))
print(s.getsockname())
print(s.recv(1024).decode())
s.send("acknowledgement recived from the server".encode())
```

CLIENT OUTPUT:
![STUDY OF SOCKET PROGRAMMING WITH CLIENT MODEL](https://github.com/Jeevapriya14/19CS406-EX-1/assets/121003043/e893dc48-9c9e-446e-a040-fb60570e3043

RESULT:
    Thus, the program to implement socket programming date and time display from client to server using TCP Sockets was successfully executed.
